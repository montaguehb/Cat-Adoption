# üêàShr√∂dinger's Cat Adoption
Welcome to Shr√∂dinger's Cat Adoption!
We were inspired by all of the animal lovers in the JSON Derulo Cohort, and we decided to create a pet adoption website.
Scroll through our selection of purrfect cats and find your furever friend!

## CLONING INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1: Visit https://github.com/montaguehb/Cat-Adoption and select "CODE"

Step 2: Copy the SSH Link 

Step 3: Clone it into your local repository using the command git clone ["paste SSH link here"]

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND AVAILABLE SCRIPTS
### `npm run server`

Runs the JSON server.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the possible endpoints in your browser.\
Whenever changes are made to the db.json file, the server reloads the file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
